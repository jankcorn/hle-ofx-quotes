  * *IMPORTANT* for UK user, please enable the following new setting *Incrementally Increased Share Count*
{{{
Edit -> Quotes -> Incrementally Increased Share Count -> set to true
}}}
  This setting supersedes the *Randomize Share Count* which is deprecated and will be remove in next build. Please set *Randomize Share Count* to false
{{{
Edit -> Quotes -> Randomize Share Count -> set to false
}}}
  Why this change is needed?
  For MS2005UK to update its price, we need to force a transaction to be recorded. Previously, randomized share count will sometimes yield 
    * (1) adding shares, sometimes 
    * (2) removing shares. 
  When (2) happens, prices are not updated. Making the share count incrementally increasing will ensure that we always add shares. Will increase in .001 increment and wrap around at .999 shares.

  * I've added an additional column in the mapper.cvs called "QuotesSourceCurrency" that you can use to specify the currency of a security if the quote source is not providing it. Example:
{{{
MSMoneySymbol,QuotesSourceSymbol,IsMutualFund,IsOptions,QuotesSourceCurrency
VINCI,DG.NX,FALSE,FALSE,EUR
}}}
  Use case: you want to get a quote price for a non-US security from Yahoo quote source (which will likely to return the the price in GPX or GPB).
  * Support multiple entries of same QuoteSourceSymbol mapping to ONE MsMoneySymbol
{{{
CIG686,MUTF_CA:CIG1786,TRUE
CIG786,MUTF_CA:CIG1786,TRUE
}}}
  Note: this will yield TWO entries (in this case CIG686, CIG786) in the generated OFX file.
