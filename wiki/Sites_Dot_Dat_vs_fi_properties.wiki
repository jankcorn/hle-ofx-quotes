#summary fi.properties vs sites.dat

= DRAFT =

= Introduction =

For those currently using PocketSense and want to try out the "Statement Download" feature in hleOfxQuotes, I am documenting equivalent concepts or settings that you are familiar with from the sites.dat file.

You should also see the *Quick Start* section at http://code.google.com/p/hle-ofx-quotes/wiki/Download_Statements_Tips

== Site vs fi dir ==

At top-level, 
  * PocketSense stores site information (URL, fi org, fi id ...) in file sites.dat in a list of `<site>....</site>` block.
  * hleOfxQuote stores the same information in a directory structure
{{{
  fi -- FI_001 -- fi.properties
     -- FI_002 -- fi.properties
     -- FI_003 -- fi.properties
}}}
