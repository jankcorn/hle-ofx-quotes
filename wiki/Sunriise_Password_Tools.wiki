#summary *.mny password tools

= Introduction =

This tool was created to help with all the poor souls who have forgotten their password and got no where else to turn. Two modes are supported:
  # [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_attack Dictionary attack]: check password against a set of dictionaries. 
  # [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute_force_attack Brute-force attack]: for a given set of alphabets, try all combination.


  * For both modes, you will need a working `*`.mny file and Java installed.
  * For *Dictionary attack*, you will need a good set dictionaries.

  * For *Brute-force attack*, you will need sufficiently CPU cycles and times. I will discuss some optimization strategy later on that you can employ to reduce the times requirement.
