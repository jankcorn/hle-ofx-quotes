#summary How to disable browser Java Plugin

= Introduction =

TODO

I am trying to give some info on the on-going security concern about Java. In particular the zero-day exploit.

= Details =

On Jan 10, 2013, CERT issued a bulletin on a new Java's security hole called zero-day exploit. CERT advises everyone to disable Java in all browser. 

'hleofxquotes' uses Java. But *NOT* via the browser's plugin. What is the difference:

 * When you run java with a tool such as 'hleofxquotes', you start the JVM with a know set of classes namely the ones from the 'hleofxquotes`*`.jar' file.
 * When Java is being invoked via the browser's java plugin, your browser access es and downloads files from remote servers and can be tricked into download and execute classes that you don't know.

My recommendation is to keep your Java installation installed as-is but *DISABLE* the browser's *Java plugin*.


For more info about the exploit, see CERT bulletin http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/625617
