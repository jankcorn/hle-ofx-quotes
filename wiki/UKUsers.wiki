#summary Read me if you are UK users.

= Introduction =

Updating quote prices for UK users is kind of work with some rough spots. I am documenting here the current state as I know it.

= Known working path =

  * Use the ft.com quote source to get UK stocks and fund price.
  * Use the latest test build (http://code.google.com/p/hle-ofx-quotes/downloads/detail?name=hleOfxQuotes-20110205_001.jar) which has support for randomized share count (it does sounds scary: financial info and randomized but this only for the Dummy account).
  * Make sure you set the randomized setting
{{{
Edit -> Randomized share count (set to true)
}}}
  * Use the mapper.csv file to map the ft.com symbol into the matching symbol in Microsoft Money.
  * Enable {{{"Force <INVTRANLIST>"}}} so that the MM will show the correct statement date
{{{
Edit -> Force <INVTRANLIST> (set to true)
}}}
  * Each time you import, you will be prompt to adjust the share count (add or remove), go ahead and let Microsoft Money does it. A reminder: for imported statement, MM will only update the share price *ONCE* a day.

== Why ft.com? ==
  
  * Best coverage for UK funds. Yahoo does not come close.
  * Alternative is Google Portfolio if you don't want to manually download the CSV file.

=== Why randomized share count ===
  
  * In US Sunset version, when we import in a zero share count. MM will happy update the price *BUT* for MM05UK, Microsoft Money seems to ignore zero share count, we need to force a actual transaction before MM will pick up the price data. Randomized share count ensure that each time you import a statement, MM will have to adjust: either to add or remove a transaction thus updating the price.

=== Why mapper.csv file? ===
  
  * For a give security (stock, fund ..) chances are symbol that ft.com provides is *NOT* the same as that in Microsoft Money so you need a way to say:
    * When dealing with ft.com, use this symbolA
    * When dealing with MM, this this symbolB

=== Why {{{"Force <INVTRANLIST>"}}} ===

  * MMM05 appears to depend on the date fields in tag {{{<INVTRANLIST>}}} for the statement date. If you don't use this work-around, the statement will show up in MM05 as having a date of 1970.
