=DRAFT=

= Introduction =

*Caveat*: I don't use multi-currency. What document here is based various email, discussion with actual multi-currency. If something is not correct, please let us know and we will get this corrected. For now, most of us are hanging out at:

MM supports multi-currency:
  * There is a based currency
  * And each security can have its own currency
  . MM will take care of converting between currencies using exchange rates which can be edit manually or via online service (which officially is off)

= Problems =

Currently we are using imported OFX statement to force quote price update. If you have multi-currency, things are not fully working yet.

Concrete example: let's say your base currency is GBP, and you have two stock
  * STOCK1 in GBP priced at 1 GBP
  * STOCK2 in USD priced at 2 USD
  * And current exchange rate is 1.5
