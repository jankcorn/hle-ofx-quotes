#summary Download statements, what security risks are there?

= Introduction =

I want to try the "Download Statements" feature, what security risks are there? What is my exposure?


== Source codes ==

At the very top level, source codes are not available so you will not be able to inspect the codes to see if I am doing *bad* things to your stuffs such as secretly transfer your *.mny file to some remote server.

I've tried to document what files, registry, URLs this tools will use here: http://code.google.com/p/hle-ofx-quotes/wiki/Files_Registry_URLs

== Username/password exposure ==

  * Username, password are not encrypted. Available in plain-text in fi.properties file.
  * On my TODO list: encrypt username/password in storage.
  * Username, password are in plain text in stored request/response files.
  * On my TODO list: keep OFX request/response in memory only.
  * Personally, I run from a TrueCrypt filesystem (http://www.truecrypt.org/) which mitigates most of the above concern.
