== Add support to download Bloomberg quote source ==
  * Has good support for international quotes
  * We have to query the quote one at the time so it is not as fast as Yahoo
  * See: http://www.bloomberg.com/
  * See: http://code.google.com/p/hle-ofx-quotes/issues/detail?id=40

== Add support to download Scholarshare quote source ==
  * New manager for Scholarshare: TIAA-CREF
  * Daily price: http://www.scholarshare.com/performance/fundperformance.shtml
  * New support including parsing above data and convert them into `*`.ofx file.
  * TODO: need additional instruction on how to generate pseudo-symbols.

== Update FX (foreign exchange rate) for a give `*`.mny file using sunriise jar file ==
  * Use sunriise to update FX rates.
  * *IMPORTANT*: this most important thing to remember is that we are modifying the `*`.mny file directly. As such, Money should NOT be running and you should try first on a copy of `*`.mny.
  * Please see this issue for background info: http://code.google.com/p/hle-ofx-quotes/issues/detail?id=27
  * There is a new tab named "Exchange Rates"
